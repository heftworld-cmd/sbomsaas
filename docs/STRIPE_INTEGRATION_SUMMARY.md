  - `/stripe/webhook/test` configuration verification endpoint
  - `/stripe/events` development endpoint for event listing
  - Proper error responses and status codes

### 2. **User Interface Updates**

  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Server-side Stripe API key
  - `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Client-side Stripe API key
  - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Webhook signature verification secret

- **Flask Configuration** (`src/config/config.py`)
  - Added Stripe configuration variables
  - Environment-based configuration management
  - Security-first approach with environment variables

### 4. **Testing & Development Tools**

  - Comprehensive webhook endpoint testing
  - Signature verification testing
  - Configuration validation
  - Customizable test parameters

- **Development Scripts Integration**
  - Updated requirements with Stripe dependency
  - Integration with existing development workflow
  - VS Code debugging configuration updates

### 5. **Documentation**
- **Comprehensive Guide** (`docs/STRIPE_WEBHOOK_GUIDE.md`)
  - Complete setup instructions
  - Security best practices
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Production deployment checklist

- **Updated Project Documentation**
  - Enhanced README with Stripe features
  - Updated project structure documentation
  - Integration testing instructions

## 🛡️ Security Features Implemented

### Webhook Security
- **Signature Verification**: All webhooks verified using Stripe's signature mechanism
- **Timestamp Validation**: Protection against replay attacks
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without information leakage
- **Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for all webhook events

### Data Security
- **Environment Variables**: All sensitive keys stored in environment variables
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Zero sensitive data in source code
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Webhook endpoints designed for HTTPS deployment
- **Input Validation**: Proper validation of all webhook payloads

## 🔄 Supported Stripe Events

| Event Type | Handler Method | Description |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| `payment_intent.succeeded` | `handle_payment_intent_succeeded` | Successful payment completion |
| `payment_intent.payment_failed` | `handle_payment_intent_failed` | Failed payment handling |
| `customer.subscription.created` | `handle_customer_subscription_created` | New subscription setup |
| `customer.subscription.updated` | `handle_customer_subscription_updated` | Subscription modifications |
| `customer.subscription.deleted` | `handle_customer_subscription_deleted` | Subscription cancellations |
| `invoice.payment_succeeded` | `handle_invoice_payment_succeeded` | Successful invoice payments |
| `invoice.payment_failed` | `handle_invoice_payment_failed` | Failed invoice payments |

## 📊 Technical Architecture

### Service Layer Pattern
```
Flask Application
├── Stripe Blueprint (webhook_routes.py)
│   ├── /stripe/webhook (main webhook endpoint)
│   ├── /stripe/webhook/test (configuration test)
│   └── /stripe/events (development utility)
└── Stripe Service (stripe_service.py)
    ├── Signature verification
    ├── Event processing
    ├── Error handling
    └── Logging
```

### Data Flow
1. **Stripe Event Occurs** → Payment, subscription change, etc.
2. **Webhook Delivery** → Stripe sends event to `/stripe/webhook`
3. **Signature Verification** → Webhook signature validated
4. **Event Processing** → Routed to appropriate handler method
5. **Business Logic** → Update user status, send notifications, etc.
6. **Response** → Success/error response sent to Stripe

## 🚀 Deployment Considerations

### Development Environment
- Uses Stripe test keys and webhook secrets
- Local webhook testing with `tests/integration/test_stripe_webhook.py`
- Stripe CLI integration for event simulation
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Production Environment
- Production Stripe keys required
- HTTPS webhook endpoint mandatory
- Webhook monitoring and alerting recommended
- Database integration for user/subscription management
